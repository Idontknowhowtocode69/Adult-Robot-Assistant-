# Adult-Robot-Assistant-
*Preface* I have extremely little to no coding knowledge/abilites. I do however have some experience with technical 3d modeling and printing (hobbyist level). This project is a large part of the driving force behind my desire to learn to code, so if any of these are goals are unrealistic or naive that is why.

The purpose of this project is develop a humanoid robot (similar to the "persocons" from Chobits, but with different astetics) that can do "anything".

Goals: features that I will be working to develop are listed below in order of highest to lowest priority.

1. Self lubricating, heating, and cleaning male masturbator. ( this will be the first priority as I plan to develop the robot as a whole in modular sections in a similar fashion to biological organisims (organism>organ groups, individual organs, tissue groups).
     1.a. My current vision for the self cleaning male masturbator will be based on Autoclave steam sterlization principles.
       1.b. Usage: The idea being that prior to use the masturbator module would run a pre-use autoclave cycle, wait for the chamber to return back down to usage temperatures, self lubricate, then notify the user through either verbal cues or on screen messages that it is ready for use. Post use, the masturbation module will seal, the robot would move to a rest room (or other designated purge point) and flush the system with DI, before running a post-use autoclave cycle.
   
3. Converstional AI driven (an LLM with the ability to interpret verbal instructions and exceute tasks based on these instructions)
4. Smart Assistant (interconnectivity with software like home-assistant through verbal commands)
5. a gaming PC ( the plan is to have a decently powerful computer nested within the robot itself, and being able to access a desktop environment would be cool)
