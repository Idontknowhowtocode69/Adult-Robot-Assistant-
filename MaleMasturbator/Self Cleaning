The proposed method of self cleaning will be steam sterlization with the water being provided by the purge tank that will also be located in the unit. 
Initial proposed heating source will be a length of resistive wire (First prototype will likely utilize Nichrome wire) wrapped around the exterior of the chamber. 
Nichrome wire has a maximum operating temperature of 900C, meaning that some form of insulation will be needed aroud the wires. 
As 900C is far to high for any foam based insulation, my initial thought was ceramic wool. However after skimming the SDS for ceramic wool, I have decided to use sand as the insulative material for initial testing.
